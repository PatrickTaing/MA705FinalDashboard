# MA705FinalDashboard
This is my dashboard on two different variants of red and white wine.
I will be going over and comparing the two types of wine in different visualizations.
I gained the data from their data folder which has 2 different excel files for the different attributes. 
The data sets are the results from a chemical analysis of wines grown in the Italy region but derived from three different cultivars. The data determines the different qualities between the 3 types of wines. 

Different attributes are important when comparing wine. When looking at wine for example, Malic Acid, one of the attributes, affects how strong the wine will taste. To high of a Malic Acid level can lead it to tasting 'sour' and a low level can lead to a 'flat' taste. 

Looking at its ash and alkalintiy levels will determine if there are toxic minerals present in the wine. 

The color intesnity, hue, and shade of its wine can also determine the PH Levels of the Wines in comparsion and can determine how strong quality of a wine can come out to. 

Proline being the most abundant amino acid presented in wine, it is present and a diagnostic importance and influenced to see the quality level of it. It will determine the quality of the wine.
